# MAVlink LEDStrip

Control WS2811 Leds attached to a MAVlink UAV using MAVlink messages.

-----

`LED_Server` Controls LED Strip(s) connected to the UAV via a Raspberry Pi on GPIOs 12 and 13.

`LED_Client` Sends LEDStripSet messages to the Drone via mavlink to be interpruted by `LED_Server`.

-----

`LED_Server` assumes the MAVSDK & WS2811 libraries are installed in the Pi, and that the MAVSDK can read MAVlink messages on the network.

`LED_Client` assumes the MAVSDK is installed on the system, and MAVLink Messages can reach the UAV.
